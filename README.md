# Overview

Mechatronics Design I addresses a wide range of goals for the learner from personal development to technical experience. While working in a team, you may be only lightly exposed to some technical skill areas, while deeply developing abilities in other technical areas. You will be responsible for your own learning, choosing areas of expertise and interest in conjunction with the rest of the team. The goals related to personal development, on the other hand, are the core learning goals for the course that will relate to every member of the team. During this course you will:

1. Plan a complex Mechatronics Design project to a fixed timeline and budget.
2. Experience working in a small but diverse team.
3. Practice informal team building skills.
4. Resolve conflicts and negotiate solutions.
5. Develop formal meeting skills.
6. Prepare formal technical reports.

# Project

You are required to design and develop a line following robot. You must design the chasis (laser cut or 3D printed), the PCB/s, and develop the control software for the robot.

# PCB Design

Full discrete logic or microcontroller.
